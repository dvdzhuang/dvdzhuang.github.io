            <ul>
                <li>Wrote front-end and back-end code for Onshape, an online CAD software service</li>
                <li>Developed new features for users, primarily using Java and TypeScript
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added ability to 'dissolve' assemblies, i.e. finding all instances of an assembly, moving
                            their parts into their respective parent assemblies, and deleting those instances.

                        </li>
                        <li>Created a new way to import projects into Onshape. This method balances performance and
                            readability in large projects. More specifically, it creates a document for each assembly.
                            For each unique part in the file, a Part Studio is created in the document containing the
                            lowest-level assembly that the part appears in.
