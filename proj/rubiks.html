            This program shows what an image might look like if someone were to create a mosaic of it using Rubik's
            cubes.
            The user can enter an image file and the number of cubes being used, and the program will output the mosaic
            representation.

        <p>
            The program first finds all possible rectangle proportions possible using the given number of cubes and
            chooses the one that most closely matches the image's proportions. In this example, I use 600 cubes. The
            closest proportions found were 24 x 25. The program centers this rectangle on the image and ignores
            everything outside of its bounds. The pixels in the cropped area are then divided into squares corresponding
            to those on the face of a Rubik's cube, with 9 squares per cube.
        </p>
        <p>
            At first, I simply took the average RGB values within those squares and found the closest matching values
            among
            the cubes' colors. The results looked pretty good for some images, but for images with low contrast or
            colors that aren't close to Rubik's cube colors, the results would be unrecognizable.
        </p>
        <p>
            To solve this issue, I used the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering" target="_blank">
                Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm</a>.
            After finding the closest match for a square, I add the "error" to the RGB values of the surrounding
            squares. As a result, the difference between the original color and the Rubik's color is accounted for. Even
            so, the dithered result only seems to look better when the number of cubes used is very high. The undithered
            mosaic also often has its own unique charm.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wrote this program using Java Swing because I had recently used it in class for my Spreadsheets project
            and this was the only UI library I knew.
            Since the algorithm just finds the closest color in a list of colors, the mosaic colors can easily be
            swapped out if your Rubik's cube has non-standard colors. A few years later, I wrote a very similar program
            in Python using the Python Imaging Library to create mosaics for Reddit's
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/place" target="_blank">/r/place</a>.
            This new version was much more robust, allowing for changing the tile size and saving the image to a file.
